# Reflection – Industry Talk 2

## What I Gained
I learned that to work in the computer science field requires more than technical
knowledge. We have to build our social skills to work with other people and keep on track about current technology development from time to time.

## Suggested Improvements
The session could be improved by adding more real-world demonstrations.

## Personal Thoughts
In my opinion,this talk session is very good for us 1st year students as it encourage us to start learning from the early ages to strive for good career in the future.
